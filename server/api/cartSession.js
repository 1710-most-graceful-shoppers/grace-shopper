// /api/users/:id/cart
// /api/users/:id/orders

//what's a cart???
//all of the products that a user wants to buy.
//This thing that relates to products and relates to a user/session.

//what's an order?
//EXACTYLY THE SAME THING except it's bought already.
//can't be changed.
//prices become fixed.

//what does an order need?
//order number
//just the userid
//some boolean representing if the order was placed.

//we need a separate join table to connect orders-products.
